Seohtracker logic
=================

This is the work in progress module containing the logic for clients like
`Seohtracker for iOS <https://github.com/gradha/seohtracker-ios>`_ or
`Seohtracker for Mac <https://github.com/gradha/seohtracker-mac>`_. Come back
later when there is some meat.

=======

`MIT license <LICENSE.rst>`_.


Documentation
=============

See the documentation index in the `docindex.rst file <docindex.rst>`_.

Changes
=======

This is development version v5. For a list of changes see the `docs/changes.rst
file <docs/changes.rst>`_.


Git branches
============

This project uses the `git-flow branching model
<https://github.com/nvie/gitflow>`_ with reversed defaults. Stable releases are
tracked in the ``stable`` branch. Development happens in the default ``master``
branch. However, this module *alone* doesn't do much, and projects are likely
using ``git submodule`` to include it, so they don't really care about
stable/development versions. The stable versions are used just to mark client
milestones.


Feedback
========

You can send me feedback through `github's issue tracker
<https://github.com/gradha/seohtracker-logic/issues>`_. I also take a look from
time to time to `Nimrod's forums <http://forum.nimrod-code.org>`_ where you can
talk to other nimrod programmers.
