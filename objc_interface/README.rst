===================================
Objective-C Seohtracker logic layer
===================================

This subdirectory contains the common Objective-C layer of the `Seohtracker
logic module <https://github.com/gradha/seohtracker-logic>`_ for the `iOS
<https://github.com/gradha/seohtracker-ios>`_ and `OSX
<https://github.com/gradha/seohtracker-mac>`_ clients.

This code alone doesn't even compile, as it tends to depend on other third
party submodules (like `ELHASO-iOS-snippets
<https://github.com/gradha/ELHASO-iOS-snippets>`_). It is meant to be directly
included in the clients.

The string ``seohyun`` used in the source code is the internal codename for
Seohtracker. It stands for `Seo Joo-hyun
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seohyun>`_, who is very strict (aka anal).
